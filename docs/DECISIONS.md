# Decision log

Append-only. Newest last. One entry per decision that would otherwise have to be
re-derived later. Keep entries short; link to the file that implements them.

## 2026-09-19 — Positioning: conformity evidence, not agent scores
Nate Herk's "Agent Report Card" is the base model. Sold as QA it is a nice-to-have
and trivially cloneable. Reframed as EU conformity evidence it maps to an obligation
the buyer already has, is recurring by construction (every policy or model change
invalidates the last report), and is defensible against a US clone because EU data
residency and EU legal framing ship last for them.
Chosen by the user over pure QA and red-teaming. See docs/THREE-PS.md.

## 2026-09-19 — Hybrid judge-model funding
Trial runs use a free-tier provider key held by us; paid workspaces must supply their
own model API key, encrypted at rest. Keeps our marginal cost at EUR 0 at any scale
while removing onboarding friction from the first run. Costs us an extra onboarding
state to build and test. Chosen by the user over pure BYOK and pure free-tier.

## 2026-09-19 — Stack: Next.js 16 + Supabase (Frankfurt) + Vercel, all free tiers
Scaffolded Next.js 16.3.5 / React 19 / Tailwind 4 / TypeScript. Supabase gives
Postgres + auth + RLS multi-tenancy in eu-central-1, which doubles as a selling
point. Nothing in the stack bills us at our volume. Vercel Hobby for hosting.

## 2026-09-19 — Project folder name cannot be an npm package name
"Project Novera" has a space and a capital, so create-next-app refused it. The app
was scaffolded elsewhere as "novera" and moved into this folder. package.json name
is "novera"; the directory name is cosmetic.

## 2026-09-19 — Next.js 16 differs from training data
node_modules/next/dist/docs/ holds the authoritative guides and AGENTS.md instructs
reading them before writing route handlers, server actions or caching code. Read the
relevant guide rather than relying on recalled Next.js conventions.
